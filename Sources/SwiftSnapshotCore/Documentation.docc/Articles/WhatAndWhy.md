# What is SwiftSnapshot and Why Use It?

Understanding the purpose, benefits, and use cases of SwiftSnapshot.

## What is SwiftSnapshot?

SwiftSnapshot is a library that generates **compilable Swift source code** from runtime values. Instead of serializing data to JSON, XML, or binary formats, it creates actual Swift files with type-safe code that you can commit, diff, and reuse.

### The Core Idea

```swift
// Traditional approach: JSON fixture
{
    "id": 42,
    "name": "Alice",
    "role": "admin"
}

// SwiftSnapshot approach: Swift fixture
extension User {
    static let testUser: User = User(
        id: 42,
        name: "Alice",
        role: .admin
    )
}
```

The Swift fixture is:
- ✅ **Compilable** - Catches breaking changes at compile time
- ✅ **Type-safe** - The compiler verifies correctness
- ✅ **Human-readable** - Easy to review and understand
- ✅ **Reusable** - Use in tests, previews, documentation, anywhere
- ✅ **Diff-friendly** - Version control shows semantic changes

## Why SwiftSnapshot Exists

### Problem 1: Test Fixtures Are Hard to Maintain

Traditional approaches have limitations:

**JSON Fixtures:**
- ❌ No type safety - typos and schema mismatches caught at runtime
- ❌ Require custom decoding logic
- ❌ Hard to review diffs
- ❌ Break silently when types change

**Hardcoded Test Data:**
- ❌ Duplication across test files
- ❌ Inconsistent values
- ❌ No single source of truth
- ❌ Time-consuming to update

**Binary Snapshot Testing:**
- ❌ Opaque diffs in version control
- ❌ Limited reusability
- ❌ Requires external tools to inspect

### Solution: Swift Source as Fixtures

SwiftSnapshot generates **Swift source code** that serves as:
- 📝 **Documentation** - Shows example values
- 🧪 **Test Fixtures** - Provides known-good data
- 🎨 **Preview Data** - Powers SwiftUI previews
- 🔍 **Debugging** - Captures real states for reproduction

### Problem 2: Refactoring Is Risky

When you refactor types, traditional fixtures break:

```swift
// You rename a property
struct User {
    let id: Int
    let fullName: String  // was: name
}

// JSON fixtures still have "name" - runtime error!
// Swift fixtures won't compile - caught immediately! ✅
```

### Solution: Compiler-Verified Fixtures

SwiftSnapshot fixtures are **verified by the compiler**:
- Rename a property → Fixtures won't compile
- Change a type → Fixtures won't compile
- Remove a case → Fixtures won't compile

The compiler **guides you** through updates.

### Problem 3: Capturing Complex State Is Manual

Creating fixtures for complex objects is tedious:

```swift
// Manually writing this is error-prone
let user = User(
    id: 42,
    profile: Profile(
        name: "Alice",
        email: "alice@example.com",
        address: Address(
            street: "123 Main St",
            city: "Springfield",
            state: "IL",
            zip: "62701"
        ),
        preferences: Preferences(
            theme: .dark,
            notifications: true,
            language: "en"
        )
    ),
    posts: [
        Post(title: "First", content: "..."),
        Post(title: "Second", content: "...")
    ]
)
```

### Solution: Generate from Live Values

SwiftSnapshot captures state automatically:

```swift
// Create object normally
let user = createTestUser()

// Generate fixture automatically
SwiftSnapshotRuntime.export(
    instance: user,
    variableName: "testUser"
)

// Now you have a reusable fixture!
let reference = User.testUser
```

## Key Benefits

### 1. Type Safety

The compiler ensures fixtures match your types:

```swift
extension Product {
    static let sample: Product = Product(
        id: "123",
        name: "Widget",
        price: 29.99,
        inStock: true
    )
}

// If Product changes, this won't compile
// You MUST update it - no silent failures
```

### 2. Diff-Friendly

Version control shows meaningful changes:

```diff
 extension User {
     static let testUser: User = User(
         id: 42,
         name: "Alice",
-        role: .member
+        role: .admin
     )
 }
```

Compare to JSON:
```diff
-  "role": "member"
+  "role": "admin"
```

Both look similar, but Swift fixture shows:
- The exact type being modified
- The full context
- Valid Swift syntax

### 3. Zero Decoding Overhead

Use fixtures directly:

```swift
// No decoding needed
let user = User.testUser

// Compare to JSON
let user = try JSONDecoder().decode(User.self, from: data)
```

### 4. Multi-Context Reuse

Use the same fixture everywhere:

```swift
// In tests
func testUserValidation() {
    let user = User.testUser
    XCTAssertTrue(user.isValid())
}

// In SwiftUI previews
#Preview {
    UserView(user: .testUser)
}

// In command-line tools
print(User.testUser.description)
```

### 5. Better Code Review

Reviewers can understand fixtures:

```swift
// Swift: Clear and readable
static let testOrder: Order = Order(
    id: "ORD-123",
    items: [
        OrderItem(product: "Widget", quantity: 2)
    ],
    total: 59.98
)

// vs JSON: Harder to parse mentally
{
  "id": "ORD-123",
  "items": [{"product": "Widget", "quantity": 2}],
  "total": 59.98
}
```

### 6. IDE Support

Full autocomplete and navigation:

```swift
let user = User.testUser  // Ctrl+click navigates to definition
                          // Autocomplete shows all fixtures
                          // Type checking works
```

### 7. DEBUG-Only Design

Zero impact on production:

```swift
// In DEBUG: Full functionality
#if DEBUG
let url = try user.exportSnapshot()
#endif

// In RELEASE: Entire library excluded
// No runtime overhead, no binary bloat
```

## Common Use Cases

### Test Fixtures

```swift
class OrderTests: XCTestCase {
    func testOrderCalculation() {
        let order = Order.sampleOrder
        XCTAssertEqual(order.total, 99.99)
    }
}
```

### SwiftUI Previews

```swift
#Preview {
    ProductDetailView(product: .sampleProduct)
}

#Preview("Loading State") {
    ProductDetailView(product: .loadingProduct)
}
```

### Documentation Examples

```swift
/// Process an order
///
/// Example:
/// ```swift
/// let result = processOrder(Order.sampleOrder)
/// ```
func processOrder(_ order: Order) -> Result { ... }
```

### Debugging

```swift
// Capture problematic state
let url = try currentState.exportSnapshot(
    variableName: "bugReproState"
)
// Now you have a reproducible test case
```

### API Response Mocking

```swift
extension APIResponse {
    static let successResponse: APIResponse = APIResponse(
        status: 200,
        data: ["key": "value"],
        headers: [:]
    )
    
    static let errorResponse: APIResponse = APIResponse(
        status: 404,
        data: nil,
        headers: [:]
    )
}
```

## When to Use SwiftSnapshot

### ✅ Good Use Cases

- Creating test fixtures from complex objects
- Capturing known-good states for regression testing
- Generating SwiftUI preview data
- Documenting expected data structures
- Building reusable reference data
- Debugging by capturing live state

### ⚠️ Consider Alternatives When

- You need to serialize data for network transmission (use Codable)
- You need to persist user data (use proper persistence)
- You need cross-language interop (use JSON/Protocol Buffers)
- Your data changes frequently (fixtures are for stable reference data)

| Duplication | ✅ Centralized | ❌ Scattered |
| Consistency | ✅ Single source | ❌ Can diverge |
| Generation | ✅ Automated | ❌ Manual |
| Maintenance | ✅ Easy updates | ❌ Time-consuming |

### vs. Binary Snapshot Testing

## Philosophy

SwiftSnapshot embodies these principles:

1. **Swift Source is the Best Format** - For Swift projects, Swift code is the most natural representation
2. **Type Safety Prevents Errors** - The compiler is your friend, not your enemy
3. **Human Readability Matters** - Code is read more than written
4. **Version Control is for Code** - Fixtures should diff like code
5. **Zero Production Impact** - Development tools shouldn't affect production
